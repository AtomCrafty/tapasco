Coming Soon...
--------------
We are working hard at the first public release of TaPaSCo, the official
successor to [ThreadPoolComposer](https://git.esa.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/REPARA/threadpoolcomposer.git).
Among many bugfixes and improvements the new version will include

  * completely re-designed command line interface to ease huge batch runs
  * SLURM compute cluster support
  * board support for the PyNQ/Arty-Z7
  * asynchronous job launches
  * MSI-X interrupts
  * significantly improved design space exploration
  * a brand new GUI!
