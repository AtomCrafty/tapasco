\section{Directory Structure}\label{sec:directory-structure}%
\tapasco{} is organized in several \emph{fixed and configurable} subdirectories.
\tblref{tbl:fixed-dirs} gives a short explanation for every directory in \tapascohome{}.
Almost all directories used in the \tapasco{} flow are configurable via its command line arguments, e.g., the \code{kernel} directory where \tapasco{} looks for \gloss{kernel.description} files of kernels (see \secref{sec:basic-usage} %on p.~\pageref{sec:basic-usage}
and \tblref{tbl:run-description} for details).

  arch & Contains threadpool architecture definitions and supporting files; one subdirectory per architecture, and a \code{common} directory for shared files. Each architecture usually contains a \code{lib} subdirectory containing the shared libraries for the architecture.\\\midrule

  doc & Installation and User Guide and their sources.\\\midrule
  kernel & Contains example kernels.\\\midrule
  examples & Example programs using the \gloss{TPC API}.\\\midrule
  platform & Contains platform definitions and support files; one subdirectory per platform, and a \code{common} directory for shared files. Each platform usually contains a \code{lib} subdirectory containing the shared libraries for the platform.\\\midrule
  project & Contains build support files.\\\midrule
  src & \tapasco{} source files; organized in compliance with sbt defaults, refer to \cite{sbt}.\\
